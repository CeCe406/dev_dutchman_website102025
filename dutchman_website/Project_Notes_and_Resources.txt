Email from PM requesting the project:
"I think the goal would be for you to develop/structure the site according to the outline, and once we are comfortable with it we would then preview 
it with ARCO (client) for their input. Once they are good with things, we would publish this, and create a QR code to put up at the kiosks 
for people to scan get more information about the site, should they desire to."

Thoughts:

We need to make sure this website is both mobile-compatible and desktop-compatible because people will mostl likely be accessing it the most via a QR code while
out on-site. 


My inital vision for this is to have a gallery of photos at the top of the site for the user to view. There will be a main photo view, and smaller photo views
in the "gallery". When the user clicks on a photo in the gallery, it will enlarge in the main photo view.

We need to think about how best to incoorperate the drone footage (also best place to host it publically so we can call into the site), and where
to strategically put photos throughout the site as well.

We also need to develop a pertinant aesthetic / color scheme for the site UI. I'm thinking we keep things minimal, clean and with colors that envoke wetlands,
restoration, outdoors.

Color scheme thought (hex codes):

I'm not sure how this works yet. But here's a share link from the Design I started. I think we'll be able to collaborate on it
